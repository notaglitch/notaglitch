Hi there! I’m Ghafoor, just a regular guy trying to figure things out. I’m passionate about languages, playing music, and running, but my real love lies in computers and technology.

I’m always eager to learn about the latest innovations and how they shape our world. Whether it’s coding, exploring new software, cybersecurity and of course AI, I find joy in understanding how things work. When I’m not online.
