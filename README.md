👋 Hi, I’m Ghafoor 👨‍💻

I’m someone who loves exploring all things tech. I enjoy coding, learning about cybersecurity, and getting into new ideas like AI. I’m always trying to figure out how things work and how they can make life better.

Outside of tech, I’m into playing music, running, and I also like solving a good Rubik’s Cube. But when it comes to my main interest, it’s all about computers and software.

I’m always experimenting with new tools, working on projects, and learning more about the latest in tech.
