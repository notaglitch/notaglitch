Hi there! Iâ€™m Ghafoor, just a regular guy trying to figure things out. Iâ€™m passionate about languages, playing music, and running, but my real love lies in computers and technology.

Iâ€™m always eager to learn about the latest innovations and how they shape our world. Whether itâ€™s coding, exploring new software, cybersecurity and of course AI, I find joy in understanding how things work. When Iâ€™m not online.
